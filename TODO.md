 - Need to export the extra sub post and get client items so they show 
   up in the docs.

 - Need body items to work, for GET & non-GET.

 - We need hard coded headers in domain and query.
   i.e. "Content-Type: application/json"

 - We should be able to add types marked up in TOML.
   i.e. [[type.Category]]
